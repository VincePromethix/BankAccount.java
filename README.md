# BankAccount.java
Creating a BankAccount class in Java is a practical mini-project that helps to strengthen my skills in object-oriented programming (OOP). It simulates a real-world banking system where i can deposit money, withdraw funds, and check balances. Through this exercise, i practice using classes, objects, constructors, methods, and encapsulation.
